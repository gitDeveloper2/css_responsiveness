          STATEMENT BY THE LAW SOCIETY OF KENYA ON THE PRESIDENTâ€™S MEMO TO AMEND

          <p>
            The Council of Law Society of Kenya, led by the president Mr. Eric
            Theuri, issued a press statement addressing the Memorandum issued by
            His Excellency the President on the proposed Constitutional
            Amendments. The Society stated that the proposed amendments are
            unconstitutional and called upon Kenyans to join the movement as it
            is our collective duty to uphold the Constitution and rule of Law.
          </p><p>
            LSK notes, with a lot of concern, that leaders in office are
            proposing constitutional amendments that touch on the root of our
            democracy and redirecting attention from other pressing national
            issues. Full statement: <b> https://bit.ly/LSKStatement</b>
